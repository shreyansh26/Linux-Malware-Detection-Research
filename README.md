Malware Analysis Research
==========================

This repository contains code for various Linux Malware Detection papers. The gitmodules are complete end-to-end project themselves. Running `make` in the root of this project runs all the 3 projects on an ELF file to generate a combined feature set CSV, on which 3 pretrained models vote whether it is a bening or malware file.

## Requirements
* [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.3/)
* [Java 8.0+](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
* [WEKA-3.6 toolkit](https://sourceforge.net/projects/weka/files/weka-3-6/3.6.13/)

## To run
* Put the ELF file to be tested in the **elf/** directory.
* Run `make`
